#### :skull: Another implementation of Conway's "Game of Life"

### Rules  (<strike>stolen</strike> borrowed from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life))

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
  
The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 
The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, 
live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, 
and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick.
Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

### Control
***LMB*** - to add a new cell (tile)

***RMB*** - to kill a cell (tile)

***Wheel Mouse*** - to zoom up/down

***MMB (holding)*** - move the camera along the axes

#### ---- UI ----
***House button*** - to reset the camera zoom and position

***Upper Plus/Minus buttons*** - to zoom up/down

***Left Reset button*** - to reset current seed

***Play/Pause*** - to start/pause the game

***Bottom Plus/Minus*** - to control the game speed

***Right min-max sliders*** - to control amount of min-max cells that can spawn and min-max boundaries within which cells can spawn. _Additionally, you can use the keyboard to enter certain numbers._

***Right Seed Textfield*** - to enter/get current seed

***Right Play button*** - to apply a seed in textfield

***Right Reset button*** - to generate a random seed 

#### <sup>*Random generation based on seeds AND sliders. To get the same result, you need to enter the same numbers in the sliders.</sup>

> #### You may use the code or sounds as you want.
